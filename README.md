# Drinking_water_Potability

The "Drinking Water Potability Prediction" project is  focused on predicting the potability of drinking water using machine learning techniques.It involves data exploration, preprocessing, and training models like Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest.The project's primary goal is to develop a model that can assess the safety of water samples based on various water quality parameters.
