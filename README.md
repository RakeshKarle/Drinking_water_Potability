# Drinking_water_Potability

The "Drinking Water Potability Prediction" project is  focused on predicting the potability of drinking water using machine learning techniques. The project's primary goal is to develop a model that can assess the safety of water samples based on various water quality parameters. Access to clean and safe drinking water is essential for human health, and this project addresses the critical need for a reliable tool to evaluate water potability.
